            <p>
                Mahatma Gandhi, born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, India, was a leader of India's independence 
                movement against British rule. Known as the "Father of the Nation," Gandhi's principles of 
                non-violence and truth (Satyagraha) remain a guiding light for civil rights movements globally.

                He led significant campaigns like the Salt March and advocated for religious harmony, social 
                justice, and the upliftment of the underprivileged. Gandhi's legacy is a testament to the power 
                of peaceful protest.

            <p>
                I admire Mahatma Gandhi for his unwavering commitment to truth, non-violence, and justice. 
                His courage to stand against oppression with peaceful resistance inspires me to pursue equality 
                and harmony in my own life. His words, "Be the change you wish to see in the world," resonate deeply.
